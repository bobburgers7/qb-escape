This is a set of simple scripts for getting data exported from QuickBooks
into a free accounting system.  They only support GnuCash for now; that is
likely to change in the future.  For details on how they work and how to
get your data out of QuickBooks, have a look at this article:

Like so much of my code, these scripts have been developed to the point
where they do what I needed, and not much further.  Enhancements are gladly
accepted, of course.

Please understand that neither I nor LWN can be responsible if these
scripts mangle your accounting data in some way.  Ensuring the integrity of
your data is your responsibility alone - look closely before you trust what
these scripts produce!
